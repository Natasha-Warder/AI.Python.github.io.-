    "a) I chose this course to familiarise myself with new coding languages and learn to navigate new software. I'm hoping that studying AI and engaging in practical work will help me to created informed opinions about AI advancements and apply knowledge to other areas of passion such as web design, digitised art and communications. \n",

    "- to learn basic python\n",
    "- to adequately navigate anaconda and Jupyter notebook\n",
    "- to understand the function of practical work within real life scenarios \n",
    "- to link ideas about AI to other areas of information studies this year\n",
